Quick answer: yes, absolutely — a few good options
✅ Best immediate option (zero setup): same Wi-Fi

If your phone and dev machine are on the same network:

Start Vite with host exposed:

npm run dev -- --host


or in vite.config.ts:

server: { host: true }


Vite will show something like:

Network: http://192.168.1.42:5173


Open that URL on your phone’s browser.

This gives you:

real mobile viewport

touch interactions

real scroll / tap / focus behaviour
Perfect for Home + SelectAirports parity checks.

✅ Best “proper” preview (still easy): temporary public URL

If you want to test away from your network:

Option A — ngrok
ngrok http 5173


You get a public HTTPS URL → open on phone.

Option B — Cloudflare Tunnel
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173


Both are excellent for quick mobile review.

✅ Best long-term workflow

When you’re ready:

Push to a preview branch

Deploy to Vercel / Netlify preview

Review on any device, anytime

This is ideal once the airports + home flows are locked.

What you cannot get from Chrome DevTools

Just to be clear (you already know this instinctively):

iOS Safari quirks ❌

touch hit-slop feel ❌

virtual keyboard behaviour ❌

real scroll inertia ❌

So real-device testing is 100% the right instinct here.
