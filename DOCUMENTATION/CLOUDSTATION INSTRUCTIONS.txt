INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

=====================================================================
To switch drives, you just type the drive letter followed by :.

Then go to your project folder

Once you see:

D:\>


Navigate normally:

cd CloudStation\xcmxfa-app


You should end up at:

D:\CloudStation\xcmxfa-app>

Pro tip (optional, but handy)

You can do it in one command:

cd /d D:\CloudStation\xcmxfa-app


The /d flag tells cd to switch drives too.

cd /d D:\CloudStation\xcmxfa-app
=======================================================================
1️⃣ Do I open the project in my CloudStation drive folder?
✅ Yes — open and work directly from the CloudStation folder

From your screenshot, this is perfect:

D:\CloudStation\xcmxfa-app\


That folder is your working copy.

How it works in practice

You open VS Code / terminal in that folder

You run:

npm install
npx expo start --clear


You edit files normally

Cloud Station syncs your source file changes in the background

💡 Important rule
Only one laptop actively editing at a time. Let Cloud Station finish syncing before switching machines.


===========================================================================

From now on, your flow is simply:

git status
git add .
git commit -m "Describe change"
git push


That’s it.
